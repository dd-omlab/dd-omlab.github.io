% out = lcmvect( in )
% Find the least common multiple (lcm) of a list of numbers. Unlike
% MATLAB's  buit-in lcm function, this one can not only handle more than two
% numbers at a time, they list can also be non-integer, thanks to MATLAB's
% 'rat' function. I don't know if I would have been clever enough to write
% 'rat' from scratch, but I was clever enough to figure out how to use it.
