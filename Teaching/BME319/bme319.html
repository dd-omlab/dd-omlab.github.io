Give yourself extra time for getting lost in the hospital.<br>Please note that there is <font color="red">NO PARKING</font> available at the VA for non patients.  The VA Police ticket aggressively and love it.<br><br>The laboratory is Room BC-300.  To find it, follow the signs to the Main Elevators or the Atrium elevators and go to the basement.<br>Follow the signs on the walls to "Ocular Motility."  We are around the corner from Radiation Therapy, and on the same hallway as the Prosthetics Lab.  <br><br>Do NOT ask the "Information" Desk for directions.  It is likely to be more confusing.<br><br><font color="red">UPDATE: There is so much unannounced construction going on that there is no predicting which corridors will be open and which will be closed.  If you come across a blocked hallway on the way to the lab, you will need to backtrack and try from the other direction.  Sorry I can't be more specific than this.  If you get really stuck, call the lab at (216) 421-3224 (or extension 5227 from a VA house phone).</font><br><br><b>PRIOR TO THE LAB:</b><FONT SIZE="4"><br>The pre-lab lecture will be on Tuesday, October 11th, from 5-6 PM, (location TBD?) in Wickenden 322.<br><a href="BMELAB_instructions_2016.pdf">Download</a> the EBME 319 handout.
