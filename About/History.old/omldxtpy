DIAGNOSES AND THERAPIES INTRODUCED BY THE OMLAB

Diagnoses
achiasma by see-saw nystagmus plus chiasmal imaging
benign nystagmus by alternate-cover test
congenital nystagmus by pathognomonic waveforms
congenital nystagmus head tremor by alerting patient
myasthenia gravis by OKN-Tensilon test
myasthenia gravis by saccadic gain-Tensilon test
spasmus nutans by waveform phase difference

Therapies
acquired nystagmus (optical stabilization)
acquired nystagmus (base-out prisims and -1S)
acquired nystagmus (dissection, tenotomy, and suture surgery)
acquired pendular nystagmus (gabapentin)
benign paroxsymal positional vertigo (exercise regiman)
congenital nystagmus (quantitative evaluation of null for surgery or prisms)
congenital nystagmus (composite or base-out prisims and -1S)
congenital nystagmus (soft contact lenses)
congenital nystagmus (afferent stimulation—vibration or electrical)
congenital nystagmus (dissection, tenotomy, and suture surgery)

Visual Acuity
 NAFX for best-corrected visual acuity in congenital nystagmus
 NAFX for best-corrected visual acuity in latent/manifest latent nystagmus
 NAFX for best-corrected visual acuity in acquired nystagmus
