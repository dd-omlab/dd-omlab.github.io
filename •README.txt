																		To Make Changes

To ensure that all paths are properly registered to allow page changes and file viewing/downloading, ALWAYS
launch the omlab_page_copy of omlab.org using "omlab.html" ("index.html" also works) NOT "file_to_be_changed.html"

Then, edit the "file_to_be_changed.html"/SAVE/REFRESH TAB.
