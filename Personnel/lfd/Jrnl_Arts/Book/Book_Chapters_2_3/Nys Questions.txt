															Questions about "nystagmus"

Some of the "nystagmus" questions posed on this list over the years have been posed in such a way to be unanswerable.
Many, because the question failed to ID the type of nystagmus involved (there are many types with different characteristics, symptoms, and treatments). This confusion among patients/parents is understandable, due to  misinformation (sometimes from their own physicians) about infantile nystagmus syndrome (INS) or fusion maldevelopment nystagmus syndrome (FMNS); these are the two most prevalent types of nystagmus seen in infancy and about which most posters on this list are concerned. The definitive book about nystagmus of infancy is available on line (omlab.org) and those seriously interested in understanding these types of nystagmus are encouraged to read it. For those specifically interested in INS or FMNS, I have made Chapters 2 (INS) and 3 (FMNS) available individually. Before posting a question, check the relevant chapter, where it might already have been answered. If there is still a question, or if the information provided raises additional questions, you will be better able to post a specific question regarding the type of nystagmus involved.
