Briefly, the extraocular muscles are cut off theglobe and relocated in such a way that patients who used a head turn to look atthings at a gaze angle where their CN was minimal could then do so whilelooking in primary position. It's described as moving the null region to straightahead. My data showed that in addition to doing that, the operation alsoreduced (damped) the CN over a broader range of gaze angles than the preop nullregion and also damped the CN at gaze angles lateral to the null.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>These secondarybenefits were not previously known and were unexplained. After getting adescription of just how the surgery was done, I hypothesized that the simpleact of cutting the tendon off the globe and sewing it back was causing thesebeneficial secondary effects. I further reasoned that for the many CN patientswho did not exhibit a null region and had no surgical option, a simple&quot;cut-and-sew&quot; procedure would damp their CN, allowing better vision.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><b>Waiting inthe Pipeline: (1979 – 1992)<o:p></o:p></b></span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Needless to say,no surgeon was eager to operate and ‘do nothing’ (medical-legal fears) so Icontinued my nystagmus research while looking for an animal model.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><b>Later in thePipeline: (1992 – 1998)<o:p></o:p></b></span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It wasn't untilabout 14 years later when studying achiasmatic Belgian sheepdogs with CN inMemphis that I had the opportunity to put my old hypothesis to the test. Iconvinced an ophthalmologist/friend (Rich Hertle) to forgo his lucrativepractice income for a few days and fly to Memphis at his own expense to try my'tenotomy' operation out on the 4 horizontal rectus muscles of the last dog wehad, before he was sacrificed for anatomical studies. He assured me it wouldn'twork but humored me and, with me as an assistant, performed the surgery whilecontinually stating that it could not work and would be mal-practice if he weredoing this on a human (it's all on video tape).<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The next day wechecked on the dog in the animal facility and his eyes were almost still. Richinsisted that the lack of nystagmus was due to the anesthesia, which he claimedhad not worn off. I said, &quot;Fine, we'll check again tomorrow.&quot; Well,the CN was still very small and the dog's behavior was suddenly more like thatof a normal dog, so much so that the caretakers thought we had switched dogs onthem. Since the dog also had vertical see-saw nystagmus (SSN) I convinced himto meet me in Memphis four months later to do the tenotomy on the 4 verticalrecti and 4 oblique muscles. The results were even more spectacular; no SSNremained.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><b>The light atthe End of the Pipeline: (1999 –2003)<o:p></o:p></b></span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>On the basis ofmy original hypothesis from human data and that one dog, the NEI sponsored amasked clinical trial on 10 adults and 5 children with CN. The positive results(improved CN waveforms and visual function) was published for the adults andare in press for the children. I hypothesized that we had interfered with aproprioceptive feedback loop that maintains muscle tension, effectivelyreducing the small-signal gain of the ocular motor plant to the centralnystagmus signal. The anatomists said, &quot;that can't be; there are no neuralcells at the distal end (enthesis) of the tendon.&quot; I replied, &quot;lookagain.&quot; Well, they did and there were. There are all manner of neuralcells there, supporting my hypothesis. I further hypothesized that since thismechanism is independent of the specific type of nystagmus, it should work foracquired types and reduce intractable oscillopsia. Again, the naysayers (thistime ophthalmologists and neurologists) said that it would not work because CNwas 'different' than acquired (adult) nystagmus, ignoring the hypothesizedmechanism of action which was independent of the type of nystagmus.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p><h1>Pipeline Output: Surgery for Acquired Nystagmus and Oscillopsia (Fall 2003)</h1><p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>We recentlytried out the tenotomy procedure on an adult with MS, acquired pendularnystagmus and intractable oscillopsia and reduced his nystagmus by 78%.

Never-the-less, the above sequence of eventsconstitute such a story with promising benefits to patients with nystagmus.<o:p></o:p></span></p></div></body></html>
